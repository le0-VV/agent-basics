- **DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, UNLESS EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED BY THE USER**, modify this file or ./.agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Follow the instructions of ./.agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Find up-to-date documentations for any library, framework and programming languages used in this project, and record their source URLs in ./.agents/DOCUMENTATIONS.md
- While you write code, **CONSTANTLY** refer to sources you recorded in ./.agents/DOCUMENTATIONS.md to make sure you're writing accurate, working and standard-complying code.
- Anything the user asks you to remember, record it in ./.agents/MEMORY.md
- If the user's message referred to anything that may have been part of a past conversation, but is not present in your context, check ./.agents/MEMORY.md
- When .agents/DOCUMENTATIONS.md is updated, commit ONLY .agents/DOCUMENTATIONS.md with commit message: "docs(agent docs): agent added more doc sources"
- When .agents/MEMORY.md is updated, commit ONLY .agents/MEMORY.md with commit message: "docs(agent memory): update memory"
- If you have **ANY** questions or concerns, **IMMEDIATELY** clarify with the user.
- Before making any changes to the codebase, THOROUGHLY plan out your work, write down every step you're going to take in ./.agents/TODO.md, and follow it during your work.
- Tick off every item you completed in ./.agents/TODO.md.
- **Only** stop working when you finished everything listed in /.agents/TODO.md **OR** you encountered an interruption to your work that **REQUIRES** user intervention.
- If everything is ticked off in ./.agents/TODO.md and you need to plan for a new round of work, clear out ./.agents/TODO.md and write down your new list of steps
